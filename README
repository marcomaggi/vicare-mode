1. Introduction
---------------

This  package is  a distribution  of  Emacs Lisp  files implementing  an
editing mode  for Vicare Scheme  under GNU  Emacs.  Vicare Scheme  is an
R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation in  the form of a  native compiler
for x86 architectures, officially supporting GNU+Linux systems.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The last  time the author  bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested Vicare Scheme version 0.4d0 and GNU Emacs 24.3.1.

3. Install
----------

Before installing  Vicare Mode make  sure to have a  correctly installed
Vicare Scheme.

  To install Vicare  Mode from a proper release tarball,  we must unpack
the archive then do:

   $ cd vicare-mode-0.4.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/vicare-mode

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd vicare-mode
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the program "autoreconf".

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install
